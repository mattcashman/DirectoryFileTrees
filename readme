Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

We occassionally asked AI to explain an error message from valgrind and
gave it some of our code if we were stuck on finding a bug.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I thought this assignemnt was very difficult with special mention To
part 2. I thought this assignment was useful in terms of leanring how 
to use debugger. I though part 1 was fun and quite useful. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Part 1 was more fun to work on than part 2. It felt frustrating to not 
have the source code when that is what we were trying to debug and it
was quite difficult to get to grips with part 2. Part 3 was quite fun 
but a bit tedious to debug after so much debugging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

checkerDT.c: (in function CheckerDT_isValid)
checkerDT.c:180:15: Format argument 1 to fprintf (%ld) expects long int gets
                       size_t: nodeCount
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match long unsigned, use +longintegral.
   checkerDT.c:179:61: Corresponding format code
checkerDT.c:180:26: Format argument 2 to fprintf (%ld) expects long int gets
                       size_t: ulCount
   checkerDT.c:179:77: Corresponding format code

We disagreed with this because we thought it was more readable and easy
to understand the way we formatted the string than how they suggest.

checkerDT.h:17:9: Function exported but not used outside checkerDT:
                     CheckerDT_Node_isValid
  A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
  use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
   checkerDT.c:58:1: Definition of CheckerDT_Node_isValid

This is not true - the good node implimentation uses this function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   checkerDT.c: line 89: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

   checkerDT.c: line 94: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

We disagreed because we had an for loop contained in an if loop to
ensure indeces were in range and it didn't affect readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None. 
(Except: "soandso.h: function soandso_function declared but no defined")

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

   ft.c: line 216: low priority: 
   A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
   this loop consists of 39 lines; consider refactoring

This is listed as an acceptable exception.

   ft.c: line 309: low priority: 
   A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
   this loop consists of 42 lines; consider refactoring

This is listed as an acceptable exception.

   ft.c: line 641: low priority: 
   A file should contain no more than 15 functions;
   this file contains 17 functions

This is listed as an acceptable exception.

   ft.c: line 267: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

pvContents is allowed to be NULL, so no.

   ft.c: line 486: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

pvNewContents is allowed to be NULL, so no.

   ft.c: line 640: low priority: 
   A source code file should contain fewer than 500 lines;
   this file contains 641 lines

This is listed as an acceptable exception.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1	   BDT_insert() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2      BDT_remove() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3      BDT_insert()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4	   BDT_toString()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5      BDT_destory()  
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

Node_compare is somewhat redundant since it only call a Path_compare 
which could have just been done by the client. Similarly, Node_toString
just can be done using Path_getPathname and Node_getPath. By removing 
these two functions, the interface would be more minimal and easier to
learn. Although they might improve the client's readability, they aren't
necessary. However, this does strengthen the coupling to the Path 
module which isn't desirable.

We think the DT interface is good as it is.
