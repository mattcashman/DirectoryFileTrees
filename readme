Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I thought this assignemnt was very difficult with special mention To
part 2. I thought this assignment was useful in terms of leanring how 
to use debugger. I though part 1 was fun and quite useful.

Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

checkerDT.c: (in function CheckerDT_isValid)
checkerDT.c:180:15: Format argument 1 to fprintf (%ld) expects long int gets
                       size_t: nodeCount
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match long unsigned, use +longintegral.
   checkerDT.c:179:61: Corresponding format code
checkerDT.c:180:26: Format argument 2 to fprintf (%ld) expects long int gets
                       size_t: ulCount
   checkerDT.c:179:77: Corresponding format code

We disagreed with this because we thought it was more readable and easy
to understand the way we formatted the string than how they suggest.

checkerDT.h:17:9: Function exported but not used outside checkerDT:
                     CheckerDT_Node_isValid
  A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
  use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
   checkerDT.c:58:1: Definition of CheckerDT_Node_isValid

This is not true - the good node implimentation uses this function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   checkerDT.c: line 89: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

   checkerDT.c: line 94: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

We disagreed because we had an for loop contained in an if loop to
ensure indeces were in range and it didn't affect readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1	BDT_insert() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2      BDT_remove() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3      BDT_insert()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4	BDT_toString()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5      BDT_destory()  
===============================================================

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
